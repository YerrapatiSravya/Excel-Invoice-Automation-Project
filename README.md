# Excel-Invoice-Automation-Project
While invoice automation isn't purely "data analysis," it's highly relevant because it shows:
->Proficiency in Excel, which is essential for any data analyst.
->Process automation skills, which companies value to reduce manual work.
->Attention to detail and real-world applicationâ€”invoices are used in finance, sales, and operations.
Iâ€™ve utilized Microsoft Excel's feature such as formulas like VLOOPKUP, IF, INDEX MATCH for automatically pull data from a table and macros for automation, conditional formatting for tracking overdue invoices, and data validation for seamless data entry. This user-friendly design enhances efficiency and significantly streamlines invoice management.
